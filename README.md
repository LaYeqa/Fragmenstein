# Fragmenstein
Scaffold hopping between bound compounds by stitching them together like a reanimated corpse.

## Aim
Given a followup molecule (SMILES) and a series of hits it makes a spatially stitched together version of the followup based on the hits.
Like Frankenstein's creation it may violate the laws of chemistry.
Planar trigonal topologies may be tetrahedral, bonds unnaturally long _etc._
This monstrosity is therefore then energy minimised with strong constraints.

Here is [an interactive example of mapped molecules](https://michelanglo.sgc.ox.ac.uk/r/fragmenstein).

It is rather tolerant to erroneous/excessive submissions (by automatically excluding them)
and can energy minimise strained conformations.

Three mapping approaches were tested, but the key is that hits are pairwise mapped to each other by means 
of one-to-one atom matching based upon position as opposed to similarity which is easily led astray. 
For example, note here that the benzene and the pyridine rings overlap, not the two pyridine rings:

### Side role: follow prediction
It can also merge fragment hits by itself and find the best scoring mergers.
It uses the same overlapping position clustering, but also has a decent amount of impossible/uncommon chemistry prevention.

## Not-docking
As a consequence, it is not really a docking algorithm as it does not find the pose with the lowest energy 
within a given volume. Consequently, it is a method to find how faithful is a given followup to the hits provided.
Hence the minimised pose should be assessed by the RMSD metric and the ∆∆G score used solely as a cutoff —lower than zero.

## Dramatis personae

> Victor, the pipeline, requires my [rdkit to params module](https://github.com/matteoferla/rdkit_to_params).

There are three main classes, named after characters from the Fragmenstein book and movies:

* ``Fragmenstein`` makes the stitched together molecules — [documentation](fragmenstein.md)
* ``Igor`` uses PyRosetta to minimise in the protein the fragmenstein followup — [documentation](igor.md)
* ``Victor`` is a pipeline that calls the parts, with several features, such as warhead switching —[documentation](victor.md)

An honourable mention goes to:

* ``mRMSD`` is a multiple RMSD variant which does not align and bases which atoms to use on coordinates —[documentation](mrmsd.md)
* ``rectifier`` is a class that corrects mistakes in the molecule automatically merged by ``Fragmenstein``.

In the absence of `pyrosetta` (which requires an academic licence), all bar ``Igor`` work.

## Work in progress

Some changes to the algorithm may happen, see [wip.md](wip.md) for more or drop me (matteo) an email.

## Laboratory

> See [Fragmenstein and COVID moonshot](covid.md).

Fragmenstein was created to see how reasonable are the molecules of fragment mergers submitted
in [the COVID moonshot project](https://discuss.postera.ai/c/covid), because after all the underlying method is 
fragment based screening.
[This dataset](https://github.com/postera-ai/COVID_moonshot_submissions) has some unique peculiarities that potentially
are not encountered in other projects.
