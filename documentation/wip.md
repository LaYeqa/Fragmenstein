* `test.py` and the various jupyter notebook I have need to go into a proper testing suite.
* Complete validation classmethod
* The mapping function can get stuck on nasty submissions in the MCS call. thread.
* Figures need remaking to reflect the current code

## Future idea
This is all a bit messy. 

Furthermore, the module is called `fragmenstein`,
which contains a class `Fragmenstein`, yet the pipeline is called `Victor`.

One _possible_ future change could be to break up the class `Fragmenstein`
into its two main modes (no-merge SMILES and automerging) and
removing the less productive options. 

Feedback welcome!
